    "## How to code in a package\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code is organized as a Python package. To develop code and complete the \n",

    "The submission code must be written in `assignment.py` and in some rare cases, \n",
    "in `test_assignment.py`. You cannot submit code outside of these two files. \n",
